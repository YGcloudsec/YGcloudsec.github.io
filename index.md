Currently looking for work

# YGcloudsec Cyber Security Home

Hello everyone, thanks for coming to check out my page. This is where I will list my CyberSec projects and talk a little about my self and my journey.

I am a Cyber Security Professional currently looking to join a team working as a Cloud Security Engineer or a similar position . After working several years at one of the top crypto currency exchanges here in the States. I was a Security Analyst L2 working mostly on EDR, breaches and triaging. After working that position for a couple of years I decided to move more towards IAM and Cloud/Network Egineering. I find the problems to be more interesting and hours less grueling.

Some of the certifications I got to further re-enforce my background are: Comtpia Network + and Security +, SPLUNK CORE Certified User and AZ-900. More to come shortly

I have done some projects on AWS but definitely more familiar with Azure but I think all cloud computing platforms are all pretty similar.

My passions outside of work are gamin, golf and crypto. Looking into how Bitcoin works and podcasts/articles around the creation of Bitcoin is what lead me to be interested Cyber Security. Trying to understand how Bitcoin is secured lead to me look into what SHA 256 is and so I went down the rabbit hole.

<em> "Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world." </em>

<h4>#1 Spinning up VMs and Pen Testing </h4>

[https://github.com/YGcloudsec/Pen-testing-lab](./another-page.html).

This project demonstrates a basic pen-testing lab setup using VMware Workstation Pro, where a Kali Linux VM is used to brute-force an Ubuntu VM over a Host-Only network. The lab includes network configuration, SSH installation, brute-force attacks with Hydra, and basic security hardening with Fail2Ban.

Lab Setup

<ul>
    <li>Host: Windows</li>
    <li>Hypervisor: VMware Workstation Pro</li>
    <li>Network: Host-Only (VMnet1, 192.168.100.0/24)</li>
    <li>VMs:
        <ul>
            <li>Kali Linux
